Ripley is a prototype of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) Emulator.

The idea was to have a leightweight emulator available in contrast to the
big standalone commercial ones like [SIEMENS plant simulation](http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_gb/products/tecnomatix/manufacturing-simulation/material-flow/plant-simulation.shtml). See *handbook_German.txt* for details.

The project was discontinued in favour of an other approach based on the
idea of writing test scripts using xUnit like test functions.

The technology used for *Ripley* is Node.js for the backend and jQuery for the fronted.
Time of development was around 2012.
